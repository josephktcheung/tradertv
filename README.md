## Problems with Idea
1. Investors aren’t going to want to share their screen
  + They get to charge how much
  + You’re investing with them

1. How investors invest isn’t the same as you would invest
  + If I’m allowed to invest with them, then that removes a lot of the weight on me.
  + Transparency into investing

1. People aren’t going to want to pay that much
  + This is a free market. People will charge as much as they are willing to pay.

1. You can’t just give your money to someone. You have to go through lots of regulatory paperwork.
  + This is a location dependant problem and something we lack understanding in.
